      <p>In this assignment I wrote three components, the successful alert, the warning alert, and a global alert component
        which group the other two. The warning and successful alerts define their template inline because it just have one
        line, so there is no need to create an html file. For the style I do created single files because it will be ugly to put
        so many css code in the component definition. Finally the alert component doesnÂ´t need a particular style, so just have
        an html file. I created two of the components manually so I have some issues with th selectors.
